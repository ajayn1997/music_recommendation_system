# Music Recommendation System

A comprehensive implementation of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation systems for music streaming platforms.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a complete music recommendation system from scratch, implementing multiple approaches and providing a production-ready REST API. The system includes:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: User-based, item-based, and matrix factorization approaches
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Audio feature analysis and user profile modeling
- **Hybrid System**: Weighted combination of multiple recommendation strategies
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multiple metrics including accuracy, diversity, and novelty
- **REST API**: Flask-based API for serving recommendations
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Realistic music data with 1,000 songs, 500 users, and 50,000 interactions

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Generate Dataset

```bash
cd src
python data_generator.py
```

This creates realistic synthetic data in the `data/` directory.

### 3. Train Models

```bash
# Train collaborative filtering models
python collaborative_filtering.py

# Train content-based filtering model
python content_based_filtering.py

# Train hybrid recommender
python hybrid_recommender.py
```

### 4. Start API Server

```bash
cd api
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## API Usage

### Get Recommendations

```bash
# Get 10 recommendations for user 1
curl http://localhost:5000/recommend/1

# Get 5 recommendations with explanations
curl http://localhost:5000/recommend_with_explanation/1/5
```

### Find Similar Songs

```bash
# Get songs similar to song 42
curl http://localhost:5000/similar/42
```

### Get Information

```bash
# Get song details
curl http://localhost:5000/song/100

# Get user profile
curl http://localhost:5000/user/1

# Get system statistics
curl http://localhost:5000/stats
```

## Core Components

### Data Generation

The `data_generator.py` script creates realistic synthetic data that mirrors real music streaming patterns:

- **Songs**: 1,000 tracks with audio features similar to Spotify's API
- **Users**: 500 users with demographic information and music preferences
- **Interactions**: 50,000 user-song interactions with realistic patterns

### Collaborative Filtering

Three collaborative filtering approaches are implemented:

1. **User-Based**: Finds users with similar taste and recommends their favorite songs
2. **Item-Based**: Recommends songs similar to those the user has enjoyed
3. **Matrix Factorization**: Uses SVD to discover latent factors in user preferences

### Content-Based Filtering

Analyzes song audio features to build user preference profiles:

- Audio feature analysis (danceability, energy, valence, etc.)
- Genre preference modeling
- User profile construction from listening history
- Rating prediction based on feature similarity

### Hybrid System

Combines collaborative and content-based approaches:

- Weighted linear combination of predictions
- Rank-based recommendation fusion
- Explainable recommendations with reasoning
- Diversity-aware recommendation generation

### Evaluation Framework

Comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions:

- **Accuracy**: RMSE, MAE for rating prediction
- **Ranking**: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K
- **Diversity**: Catalog coverage, genre diversity, feature diversity
- **Novelty**: Recommendation surprise factor

## Example Results

## Customization

### Adjusting Hybrid Weights

```python
# Create hybrid recommender with custom weights
hybrid = HybridRecommender(cf_weight=0.7, cb_weight=0.3)
```

### Adding New Features

The modular design makes it easy to:

- Add new audio features to content-based filtering
- Implement additional collaborative filtering algorithms
- Create new evaluation metrics
- Extend the API with additional endpoints

### Using Custom Data

Replace the synthetic data with your own:

1. Format your data to match the expected schema (see `data/` directory)
2. Update file paths in the source code
3. Retrain models with your data

## Advanced Features

### Explainable Recommendations

The system provides explanations for recommendations:

```python
explanations = hybrid.recommend_with_explanation(user_id=1, n_recommendations=5)
for exp in explanations:
    print(f"Song: {exp['song_id']}")
    print(f"Reason: {exp['explanation']}")
    print(f"CF Rating: {exp['cf_rating']:.2f}")
    print(f"CB Rating: {exp['cb_rating']:.2f}")
```

### Diversity Optimization

Generate diverse recommendations:

```python
diverse_recs = hybrid.recommend_diverse(user_id=1, diversity_factor=0.3)
```

### Real-time Evaluation

Evaluate models on test data:

```python
evaluator = RecommenderEvaluator()
train_data, test_data = evaluator.split_data(interactions_df)

# Train model on training data
hybrid.fit(songs_df, train_data)

# Evaluate on test data
results = evaluator.evaluate_rating_prediction(hybrid, test_data)
print(f"RMSE: {results['rmse']:.3f}")
print(f"MAE: {results['mae']:.3f}")
```

## Production Considerations

This implementation provides a solid foundation for production systems but would require additional considerations:

- **Scalability**: Distributed computing for large datasets
- **Real-time Updates**: Incremental learning and model updates
- **Caching**: Multi-level caching for performance
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting
- **Privacy**: Data anonymization and differential privacy
- **A/B Testing**: Experimentation framework for continuous improvement
